This project investigates the frequency behavior of four active high-pass filters by comparing their modeled transfer functions. An initial design was created using an ideal operational amplifier model, followed by three realistic models that account for the frequency-dependent open-loop gain characteristics of real-world devices: the LM741, the OP27, and the OP77. Using datasheet information, transfer functions were created for each op-amp by analyzing their open-loop gain versus frequency characteristics. Bode plots were generated using Python to compare the frequency responses. Key differences in gain roll-off, bandwidth, and phase shift were identified, particularly at higher frequencies where op-amp limitations become significant. These findings highlight important considerations for active filter design, demonstrating that non-ideal op-amp behavior can notably affect filter performance, especially in applications requiring high precision at elevated frequencies.
